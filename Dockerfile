# One image, one stage. The toolchain stays in it so the engine is built *and*
# run from the same container: edit a crate, hit the command again, and only
# what changed recompiles. A two-stage release image would throw the toolchain
# away and make every engine edit a full rebuild, which is the opposite of what
# you want while working on the engine.
#
# Pinned to the toolchain this is developed against. Do not lower it to a
# guessed MSRV: the graphics stack pulls transitive crates that raise their
# own floor between patch releases (ordered-float wanted 1.90 the first time
# this image was built against 1.88), and finding that out is a container
# rebuild each time.
