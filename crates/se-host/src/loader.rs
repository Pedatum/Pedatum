//! Opening a module, and letting go of one.

//! Two things make hot swap work here. The host copies every string and byte
//! out of the image at registration time, so nothing it keeps points into a
//! library it might drop. And each load goes through a fresh file on disk,
//! because `dlopen` hands back the *same* handle for a path it already has
//! open — reload the same path and you get the old code back, silently.
